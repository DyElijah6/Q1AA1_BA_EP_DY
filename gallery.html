                <H1>ELIJAH'S INTERESTS??</H1>
                <p>Eli likes the artist drake as he makes solid bombs, his albums are a no-skip for Eli. Second, Eli
                    has been playing with the Rubiks cube ever since she was in 4th grade! This is her favorite
                    toy out of dozens of products out there. Thirdly, Elijah loves
                    the scream franchise! She likes how the concept goes around her head, a written book inside a movie! 
                    Films!! Watching movies is Eli's favorite pass time! ZZZ, sleeping... HEHE Elijah loves to sleep
                    especially on the weekends! This is also her way of coping and relieving herself. Last but not the least,
                    MUSIC!! Music is Eli's solace, listening to music has never failed Eli. Music is always there for Eli, and 
                    Eli is always there for music..
